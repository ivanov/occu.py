This contains the code of the sign I used at the West Coast Port Shutdown in
Oakland.

The posted contained this code::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from UCB import occupyCal
    from Oakland import Port

    for member in OccupyCal:
        member.marchTo(Port)

However, folks on Reddit (rightfully) criticized it for not being PEP-8 compliant.
